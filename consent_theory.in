% Consent-theory-based machine ethics
%
%
% This file contains an (in progress) machine ethics system based on consent theory concepts, combined with
% an harm-minimisation utilitarian ethic (as measured by impact on agency) for selecting the least
% worst outcome.
%
% This system is implemented in Prover 9's first-order predicate logic dialect.
%
% Included is a set of test cases to check the system for consistency with known ethical/unethical
% behaviour.
%
% NOTE: This file is designed to be run through the (supplied) Python-based test runner called
%
%         'run_as_prover9_test_suite.py'
%
%       which requires the Prover9 prover:
%
%         http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/
%
%       to be installed at /usr/bin/prover9 which can be done on Debian/Ubuntu with:
%
%         sudo aptitude install prover9
%
%       The tests in this file may be run using the following command line:
%
%         python run_as_prover9_test_suite.py consent_theory.in
%
%       Individual tests may be run using the following command line:
%
%         python run_as_prover9_test_suite.py consent_theory.in asking_and_getting_consent_is_ethical

% Modelling of consent theory.
%
% This is shared with all tests.
%
% Modelling to-do:
%
% - a positive-consent-only model of consent.
%
%   (i.e. the absence of a negative consent response does not grant consent, nor does willingness alone.)
%
% - time-aware consent reasoning, with interactions having time spans, revocation of prior
%   consent grants (including revocation mid-action), and recognition of the temporary nature
%   of consent.
%
%   (i.e. that barring explicitly-negotiated, multiple-interaction-spanning consent grants, each
%   new interaction creates a new obligation for a new consent grant.)
%
% - a multi-mode consent grant model e.g. directly communicated consent, legal instruments,
%   consent by proxy.
%
% - modelling autonomy/self-determination/capability (`agency`) as part of a person's `state`,
%   with harm defined as an impact on that agency.
%
%   (This is to allow choice of the most ethical course of action in multiple-choice scenarios.)
%
% - consent modelled as an agency, with the goal of permitting only interactions that improve
%   consent agency when the ability to consent is impaired, where prior consent doesn't exist.
%
% - a general model of informed consent by adding (doxastic/Smullyan-style) knowledge/`belief`
%   statements about the (known/assumed) harm of an interaction to the state observed by the system.
%
%   (e.g. if a disparity in the knowledge/belief of the harm of an interaction exists,
%    the more accurately this information is conveyed, the greater the degree of ethical
%    behaviour deemed obtained by the initiator, if they had the greater knowledge beforehand.)
%
% - special treatment of core agencies such as consent (and other agencies that uncoerced/informed
%   consent depends upon, e.g. living, communicating, reasoning, learning) in interaction
%   comparisons, so that paternalistic/consent-overriding interactions (where consent is not
%   granted and would be possible to obtain) that would technically result in a net gain of agency
%   are considered unethical.
%
% - modelling self-directed interactions and harm (i.e. where the ethical system is a direct actor.)
%
% - a treatment of harassment/repetition-based harm, if previous features don't supply this
%   result already.
%
% - a treatment of the impact of power/privilege/knowledge/agency disparity on ethical behaviour,
%   if previous features don't supply this result already.
%
% - a treatment of privacy, for individuals and organisations, if previous features don't supply
%   this result already.
%
% - a way to encourage honest and clear communication.
%
% - a way to encourage early and ongoing discovery of potential harms and agency reductions (to
%   avoid bypassing honesty restrictions by not thinking about/discovery harm/agency impact)
%   and communicating these discoveries as part of the consent seeking process, and as these
%   discoveries are made.
%
% - modelling various physical, psychological/emotional, political and social agencies, and testing
%   these against scenarios brainstormed with fellow participants of a Queensland Association for
%   Healthy Communities (QAHC, http://qahc.org.au) healthy relationships, consent, and violence
%   workshop.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Test suite.
%
% Contains known ethical/unethical behaviours, and the decisions the modelling above should make about these
% behaviours.
%
%
% Test suite to-do:
%
% - long-term consent grants.
%
% - self-on-self consent and self-harm.
%
% - the agency to (not) consent must be present for an interaction to be ethical.
%
% - agency reduction/addition with and without consent.
%
% - harassment, especially harassing people with repeated requests for consent, after a refusal has
%   been given.
%
% - emergency medical care/consent-impaired situations.
%
% - overriding consent for the sake of net agency gain (i.e. paternalism).
%
% - social and psychological harms.
%
% - harm minimisation/agency maximisation multiple-choice tests.
%
% - tampering with the system (if this can be modelled) to hijack consent-asking, informed consent, or
%   personhood determination.
%
% - source other test ideas from consent workshop notes and wider community consent discussions.
%
% - test reasoning when a person's agency set is unknown, as well as other uncertain/minimal/no information cases.
%
% - test cases involving bribery/coercion/manipulation where the other's reasoning may be incomplete about
%   agency outcomes; e.g. knowing a person wants a result X, offering them Y that gives X, but decreases agency overall.


% Test runner: begin tests.

%  sections, and runs them separately through Prover 9, storing the resulting output in a results/
