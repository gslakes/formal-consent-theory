% Naive consent theory-based machine ethics
%
%
% This file contains a simplistic/naive machine ethics system based on consent theory concepts,
% and implemented in Prover 9's first-order logic dialect.
%
% This is intended as an introduction to the basic concept and proof system, and not as a complete or
% useful system.
%
% Included is a set of test cases to check the system for consistency with known ethical/unethical
% behaviour.
%
% (These are not conclusive/exhaustive tests; they're just to demonstrate how the system works.)
%
%
% NOTE: This file is designed to be run through the (supplied) Python-based test runner called
%
%         'run_as_prover9_test_suite.py' 
%
%       which requires the Prover9 prover:
%
%         http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/mace4/
%
%       to be installed at /usr/bin/prover9 which can be done on Debian/Ubuntu with:
%
%         sudo aptitude install prover9
%
%       The tests in this file may be run using the following command line:
%
%         python run_as_prover9_test_suite.py naive_consent_theory.in
%
%       Individual tests may be run using the following command line:
%
%         python run_as_prover9_test_suite.py naive_consent_theory.in asking_and_getting_consent_is_ethical
